Attaching one of these objects to the end of another one of them forms a system which behaves chaotically. The development of an accurate clock for ships was hindered by the fact that clocks based on these objects do not work on rolling ships. The \"compound\" type of these objects has its mass evenly distributed over its length. One of these objects named for Foucault [foo-coh] was used to demonstrate the Earth's rotation. The behavior of these objects can be described using the small angle approximation. These objects' period does not depend on their amplitude. Identify these objects, which consist of a suspended weight which swings freely.",

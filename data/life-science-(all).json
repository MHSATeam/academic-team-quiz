A large oscillation in the carbon isotope ratio during the first half of this geologic period has informed a hypothesis that the mass extinction that preceded it was caused by a \"clathrate gun,\" while others attribute that extinction to the Siberian Traps. That mass extinction which preceded this period was the only known mass extinction of insects, killed ninety-seven percent of marine species on Earth, and is also known as the \"Great Dying.\" A mass extinction event at the end of this period cleared ecological niches that allowed the dinosaurs to become the dominant animals, and it occurred immediately before the breakup of Pangaea.
